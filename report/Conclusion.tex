\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}

As can be seen in the videos provided and in the code, we have implemented a visual odometry pipeline with both stereo and monocular initialisation. Furthermore, we have added features such as automatic selection of initialisation frames, relocalisation and bundle adjustment. \\
Furthermore, we have tried to calibrate a smartphone camera and recorded our own dataset. This also showed us the difficulties in recording data and the limitations of our VO pipeline. \\
However, there is also room for improvement. Future work would include a further refinement of the full bundle adjustment online and loop closure.
