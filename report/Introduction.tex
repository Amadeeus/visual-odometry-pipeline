\label{s:Introduction}

As part of the Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics course at ETH \& UZH in Zurich, we developed a Visual-Odometry pipeline that is briefly summarized in this report. Videos of our code showing its performance on the three provided datasets:

\begin{enumerate}
\item KITTI
\item Malaga\_07
\item Parking
\end{enumerate}
